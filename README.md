# Chubby Buddy - An Android App by Thomas Oh

This is an android app I built using Java, for the CS50x final project.

The basic idea is that it is a fitness app - a fun little 'buddy' to help you keep track of how healthy you currently are, both in terms of fitness and diet.

- For both diet and fitness, there are 10 "levels" that a user can manually adjust. The picture rendered at each level is different
- It uses a tabbed layout
- Data is persisted through the SharedPreferences API
- A pedometer is also implemented as a little add on for the fitness aspect


Thanks!
